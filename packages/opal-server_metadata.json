  "summary": "OPAL is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes to both policy and data and pushing live updates to your agents. The opal-server creates a pub/sub channel clients can subscribe to (i.e: acts as coordinator). The server also tracks a git repository (via webhook) for updates to policy (or static data) and accepts continuous data update notifications via REST api, which are then pushed to clients.",

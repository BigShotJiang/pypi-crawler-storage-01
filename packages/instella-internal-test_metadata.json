If You institute patent litigation against any entity\n        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n        Artifact and/or a Contribution incorporated within the Artifact\n        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\n        licenses granted to You under this License in connection with the\n        Artifact shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or\n        filed.\n        \n        Licensor and Contributor each have the right to grant the licenses\n        above.\n        \n        Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION\n        \n        4. Use-based Restrictions. The restrictions contained in the AMD\n        Responsible AI Use Policy set forth in Attachment A are mandatory Use-\n        based restrictions. Therefore You may not Use the Artifact in violation\n        of such restrictions. You may Use the Artifact only subject to this\n        License; if Section II is held unenforceable or inapplicable, this\n        Section III will continue to govern any use of the Artifact. You shall\n        require all of Your users who Use the Artifact or its Derivative\n        to comply with the terms and conditions of this License, including\n        those contained in this paragraph, and only for the Permitted Purpose.\n        \n        5. The Output You Generate with a Model (as Artifact). Except as set\n        forth herein, Licensor claims no rights in the Output You generate. You\n        are accountable for the Output You generate and its subsequent uses. No\n        use of the Output may contravene any provision as stated in this\n        License.\n        \n        6. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote\n        access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute\n        copies of the Artifact or its Derivatives in any medium, with or without\n        modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n        \n        6.1.  Use-based restrictions in paragraph 4 MUST be included as a\n              condition precedent to effect any type of legal agreement (e.g. a\n              license) governing the use and/or distribution of the Artifact or\n              its Derivatives, and You shall give such notice to any subsequent\n              Third Party recipients;\n        6.2.  You shall give any Third Party recipients of the Artifact or its\n              Derivatives a copy of this License;\n        6.3.  You shall cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;\n        6.4.  You shall retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\n              notices excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Artifact or its Derivatives.\n        6.5.  You and any Third Party recipients of the Artifact or its\n              Derivative shall adhere to the Permitted Purpose.\n        \n        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may\n        provide additional or different license terms and conditions with\n        respect to paragraph 6.1., to govern the use, reproduction, or\n        Distribution of Your modifications, or for any Derivative, provided that\n        Your use, reproduction, and Distribution of the Artifact or its\n        Derivative otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this\n        License. In other words, the Use-based restrictions in Attachment A form\n        the minimum set of terms for You to license to Third Parties any\n        Artifact or its Derivative, but You may add more restrictive terms if\n        You deem it necessary.\n        \n        Section IV: OTHER PROVISIONS\n        \n        7. Updates and Runtime Restrictions. To the maximum extent permitted by\n        law, Licensor reserves the right to restrict (remotely or otherwise)\n        usage of the Artifact in violation of this License or update the\n        Artifact through electronic means.\n        \n        8. Trademarks and Related. Nothing in this License permits You to make\n        use of Licensors’ trademarks, trade names, logos or to otherwise suggest\n        endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between the parties; and\n        any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Licensors.\n        \n        9. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed\n        to in writing, Licensor provides the Artifact (and each Contributor\n        provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR\n        CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without\n        limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\n        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\n        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Artifact,\n        and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under\n        this License.\n        \n        10. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless\n        required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent\n        acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You\n        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or\n        consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this\n        License or out of the use or inability to use the Artifact (including\n        but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer\n        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or\n        losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of\n        such damages.\n        \n        11. If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal or\n        unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be unaffected thereby and\n        remain valid as if such provision had not been set forth herein.\n        \n        12. Term and Termination. The term of this License will commence upon\n        the earlier of Your (a) acceptance of this License or (b) accessing the\n        Artifact; and will continue in full force and effect until terminated in\n        accordance with the terms and conditions herein. Licensor may terminate\n        this License if You are in breach of any term or condition of this\n        License. Upon termination of this License, all licenses granted to You\n        will terminate and You must promptly delete and cease use of the\n        Artifact. Sections 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 survive termination of\n        this License.\n        \n        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n        Attachment A\n        \n        AMD Responsible AI Use Policy\n        \n        AMD is committed to the responsible use of its Artificial Intelligence\n        (AI) products and technologies (“AMD AI”).
